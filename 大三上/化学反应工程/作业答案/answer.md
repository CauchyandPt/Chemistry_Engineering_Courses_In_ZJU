 for the elementary reaction in a Plug flow reactor

for second order reaction,  KCAOT= XA/(1-XA)  XA= conversion =0.96 and CAO=1 mol/L

KT= 0.96/(1-0.96)=24 CA= CAO*(1-XA)= 1*0.96= 0.04

K= 0.04/T

T = space time = V/VO, V= volume of reactor and Vo= volumetric flow rate.

when Mixed flow reactor 10 times large as plug flow reactor is connected in series, T'= 10T

 and for mixed flow reactor KCA'T'= XA/(1-XA)2 ( since the concentration at the inlet to second reactor is 0.04)

 KT'=240

KCAT'= 240*0.04= XA/(1-XA)2  this when solved gives XA= 0.725 and final concentration = 0.04*(1-0.725)=0.011 mole/L

fraction of increase in conversion = (0.04-0.011)/0.04=0.725

for higher order reactions, PFR gives better conversion than MFR. Hence PFR reactor should come first and then MFR.
